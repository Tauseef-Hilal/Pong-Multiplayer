# PONG - MULTIPLAYER

## About
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table 
tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving<br> 
vertically across the left or right side of the screen. 
They can compete against another player controlling a
second <br> 
paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to 
hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to 
reach <br> 
eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when 
one fails to return the ball to the other
